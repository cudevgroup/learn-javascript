# Learn JavaScript
JavaScript has become essential for many developers as it is the language of the web. Virtually every website you visit uses JavaScript. JavaScript also runs on smart phones, PCs, servers, IoT devices and more. You really can't go wrong with JavaScript. It's currently the most popular programming language in the world, and job opportunities abound left, right and center. JavaScript is also easy and fun to learn, so there's that.


## FreeCodeCamp
[FreeCodeCamp][1] provides an interactive learning web platform where you can learn JavaScript by solving challenges and working on projects. We run a program at Covenant University Developers Community (CDC) where members can learn to code in JavaScript with FreeCodeCamp. We'll help you stay on track while learning and provide guidance when you're faced with difficulties. To join the program:

- [Register][1] to get an account on FreeCodeCamp. 
- Join the **#freecodecamp** channel on [our Slack][2].
- Request for a mentor on the channel.
- Solve challenges, complete projects, share your progress and teach others.

## Mentorship
Everyone in the program is assigned a mentor. You'd work on a plan for completing a set of challenges or lessons with your mentor and they'll monitor your progress and assist you where necessary. You may meet physically and/or online depending on what works best for both you and your mentor.
